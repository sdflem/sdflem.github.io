## Research

My research areas of interest are software engineering and human&ndash;computer interaction.
I direct the [Human-Oriented Software Engineering (Human-SE) Lab](https://human-se.github.io/).

### Human-Oriented Software Engineering

My research is concerned with understanding the challenges that software developers face in performing their tasks, and to design tools that reduce errors and improve productivity. I take a human-centered approach, empirically studying developers to inspire and evaluate tools. I am interested in a variety of different programming populations, including experienced professionals, new computer science graduates, end-user programmers, and programming novices/learners.


## Bio

I am currently an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Memphis. From 2009 to 2011, I did a post-doc at Oregon State University with Margaret Burnett. I received a PhD in computer science from Michigan State University in 2009. From 2001 to 2003, I worked full-time as a computer-science instructor at Western Michigan University. I received an MS in computer science and a BA in fine art from WMU in 2001 and 1999, respectively.
