## Research

### Human-Oriented Software Engineering

My research is concerned with understanding the challenges that software developers face in performing their tasks, and to design tools that reduce errors and improve productivity. I take a human-centered approach, empirically studying developers to inspire and evaluate tools. I am interested in a variety of different programming populations, including experienced professionals, new computer science graduates, end-user programmers, and programming novices/learners.
